 I completed a project where I used a YouTube Downloader! I used YouTube API, HTML, CSS, and dynamic JavaScript.
 In the project, I display a collection of videos, and you can either click 'Watch' to open the video page and watch it or click 'Download' to go to the download page.
 It's a simple and user-friendly project!"
